                                            Math is a tiresome chore for many middle and high school students. To others, it is the most intriguing subject in the world. No matter how a student feels about math, it is an essential field of education. Moreover, math is inescapable. Contrary to popular belief, mathematical concepts also apply to real-world concepts. Numbers and logic are an integral part of our lives. Thus, being good at math is a huge flex.However, most middle, and high school math classes are hard. As a result, students can quickly lose interest and motivation. Ultimately, this leads to poor understanding of concepts and performance.Types of math classes in middle and high schoolThere are multiple kinds of math classes in middle and high school. However, they generally follow a specific order. The order of math classes in middle and high school is as follows:Algebra 1 –&nbsp;This is the start of a student’s high school mathematical journey. While Algebra 1 is typically taken in 9th grade, many students attempt it in middle school. This class isn’t as tricky as the rest of the math classes. This is the foundation course for the rest of high school math courses. Algebra 1 concepts are important to do well on PSAT, SAT and ACT tests.Geometry –&nbsp;The next class in line is geometry. Geometry is about shapes, proofs, logic, and reasoning with real-world geometrical applications. Geometry concepts are important to do well on PSAT, SAT and ACT tests.Algebra 2/Trigonometry –&nbsp;This is where the math starts getting tricky. Students now need to solve complex problems. Moreover, they must learn concepts like complex inequalities, graphs, quadratics, probability, polynomials, and much more. Algebra 2 concepts are important to do well on PSAT, SAT and ACT tests.Pre-Calculus –&nbsp;As the name suggests, this math class helps prepare students for Calculus. This class covers series and sequences, limits, probability, derivatives, vectors, functions, and more.Calculus –&nbsp;This is the last step in the math learning journey. This course is an extension of the knowledge you’ve gained in Pre-calculus, studying curves, differentiation, limits, and functions.How to make middle and high school math classes fun and engaging?To make math classes fun and engaging, try Math-Knots. Math-Knots offers all the learning material your child needs to excel in math. From virtual classes to in-person classes and books, Math-Knots provides a multi-faceted approach to learning math.Consequently, Math-Knots makes math a fun and easy learning subject!
